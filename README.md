# Objectives:
✔ Implement AI Agents for Cricket Insights – Use Phi’s multi-agent system to retrieve and summarize live scores, player stats, and news.
✔ Enable Real-Time Cricket Updates – Integrate DuckDuckGo API for fetching latest match scores, player performance, and cricket news.
✔ Leverage OpenAI’s GPT-4o for Response Generation – Use LLM-powered reasoning to summarize and format results in an easy-to-read markdown table.
✔ Automate Data Retrieval and Summarization – Ensure AI agents independently search, analyze, and compile structured cricket updates.
✔ Enhance User Readability and Experience – Use Markdown tables and structured responses for clear cricket analysis.

# 📖 Project Description:
This project is an AI-driven Cricket Insights Assistant that uses Phi’s multi-agent system to provide real-time cricket scores, player statistics, and news updates. The system consists of three specialized AI agents, each responsible for different tasks:
🔹 Live Match Agent – Fetches and summarizes ongoing cricket match scores, key players, and match situations using DuckDuckGo.
🔹 Player Stats Agent – Retrieves and organizes recent batting and bowling statistics for cricket players.
🔹 Cricket News Agent – Scrapes and summarizes the latest cricket news, including upcoming tournaments and player updates.

* The Cricket Team AI acts as a super-agent, coordinating all three agents to generate a comprehensive cricket analysis report with markdown-based structured outputs.
